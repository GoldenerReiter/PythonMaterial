print(True is True)  # True and True use the same space in memory, so it will be True.
print([] is [])  # [] is a data structure, so everytime you declare one, it will use a different space in memory.
print([] == [])  # But it has the same value, so == will say that [] is equal to [] in value, but not in identity.
