# complex -> a very complex number (?)

print(bin(78))  # For knowing which binary number is the base of the representation of a number

print(int('0b1001110', 2))  # 0b1001110 is 78 and 2 tells the system to translate a binary number

# If you put 1 or 3, for example, instead of that 2, you'll get an error
